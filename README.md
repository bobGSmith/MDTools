## About    <a name = 1></a>
I started writing and making notes in markdown recently, so I made a python script that will add and update a tables of contents to a markdown document. It may never happen, but I if I make any more markdown related stuff I'll add it here. 

## Contents table generator (mdToC.py)<a name = 2></a>
### Input document format
Adds a Table of Contents to a markdown file below the title (formatted using heading one "#"), if there is a title. Sections titled with heading 2 "##" will be included in the contents table. Sub headings (e.g. "###") wont be included in the contents page. It doesn't like it if you use heading 1 "#" for section headings.

### Quick start
Run the script from terminal, it takes one argument, which is the path to your md file. Should look like this:

	>python mdToC.py "/path/your_file.md" 

This will then ask you if you want to overwrite the original or make a new markdown file. It will then output the file with a table of contents added (it will look like the table of contents on this README.md file)

## Why<a name = 3></a>
I also need to learn how to use github properly for some other projects, so I'm testing a few things here. Also, the Table of Contents in this README.md file was generated by the mdToC.py script :)
